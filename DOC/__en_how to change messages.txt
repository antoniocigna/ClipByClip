All messages are handled by two scripts:
	1) ClipByClip_builder_msg1_messages.jstxt
	2) ClipByClip_builder_msg2_mger.jstxt

To change the message text or add a new language just change the ClipByClip_builder_msg1_messages.jstxt script

	];


All messages in a language are found in a single variable whose name is formate by the constant 'msg_' and 2-letter language code.

The msg_xx variable is made up of several lines, one for each message.
	Each message is identified by a 3-digit number between '(.' And '))'. for example: (.701))

	Each language is identified by an element of the 'list_msg00' list.
	and each of these elements is in turn a list that consists of:
		- 2-character language identifier (e.g. en)
		- name of the language (English)
		- name of the variable that contains all the messages of the language (e.g. msg_en)
	eg. ["en", "<b>English</b><br>", msg_en]

Each message with number nnn overlaps the text of the html file which has the identifier 'm' + nnn.
(For example the text preceded by (.701)) overlaps the text with id = 'm701').

To change the text of a message in the html file, just change the line with the same identifier in variable msg_xx where xx is the language code.

To add a new language (e.g. French) simply create a new msg_xx variable (e.g. var msg_fr)
	using the existing variables as a model and with the same identifiers,
	and then add a new line in the 'list_msg00' variable. 
	eg ["fr", <b>Fran√ßais</b><br>", msg_fr]

Pay attention to quotes and commas.
