00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,351
If you must record my exploits

182
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,726
I do wish you'd put less emphasis
on the melodramatic

183
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,199
and more on the
intellectual issues involved

184
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,727
More on the intel . . .
What do you mean by that?

185
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,543
Well I do hope you'd given, uh

186
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,245
The Woman a soul

187
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:41,805
She had one you know

188
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:43,350
"The Woman"

189
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,515
I suppose you mean Irene Adler

190
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:46,683
Yes

191
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,249
I shall always remember her

192
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,867
as The Woman

193
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,372
(knock)

194
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,687
(Watson) Come in

195
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,130
Hey! Stinky

196
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,983
Fatso, old boy, how are you?

197
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,047
How are you, old boy?
Haven't seen you for years

198
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,729
I want you to meet my old friend
Sherlock Holmes

199
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,550
Holmes, this is Stinky

200
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,094
in other words, Julian Emery

201
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:18,334
How do you do, Mr. Emery?

202
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,602
Watson has often spoken of you

203
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:20,400
Oh, has he?

204
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,207
Yes, we were at school together

205
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,910
It was more years ago
than I care to remember

206
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,822
but you didn't come in here
just to remind me of that

207
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,987
No, I just happened to be
in the neighborhood and

208
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:29,127
saw your lights burning

209
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,392
so I took the liberty of looking you up

210
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:33,065
Still writing your mystery stuff?

211
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,754
Yes, there's a new one out this week

212
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,541
Good, I never miss 'em

213
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,781
Oh, good, thanks!

214
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:40,049
I say, that bandage
makes you look very interesting

215
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:43,330
still poking your nose into
other people's business as usual?

216
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,533
I haven't a value's notion

217
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,686
Somebody bopped me on the head
in my own living room

218
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:51,170
and then proceed to commit the most
idiotic burglary you ever heard of

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,249
Fellow must have been as barmy as a coot

220
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,234
Barmy, why?

221
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,433
Come sit down, old boy

222
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,318
You like a cup of tea?

223
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:00,647
Huh? Oh, alright

224
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:03,150
I'll go and [inaudible]

225
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,362
Why do you say the robbery
was idiotic, Mr. Emery?

226
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,982
Oh, simply for the fact that

227
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:13,008
with about £5000 worth of
musical boxes in my living room

228
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,229
the thief who I caught in the act

229
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,574
made off with one that isn't even worth £5

230
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:20,012
I gather you're a collector
of musical boxes

231
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,489
<i>Yes, I am indeed</i>

232
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:22,699
<i>Some of them very beautiful</i>

233
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,027
but not the one that was stolen

234
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:26,970
The thief evidently grabbed
the first thing that came to his hand

235
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,747
when he heard me coming into the room

236
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,018
Isn't it rather odd isn't it
that having disposed of you

237
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,218
he didn't pick up something more valuable?

238
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,353
Was there anything unusual about the stolen box?

239
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:38,928
No, nothing at all

240
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,012
I picked it up in the south of France
several years ago

241
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,522
You say you have many valuable music boxes

242
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,923
yet the thief made of with one
that isn't worth £5

243
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,304
Sounds like rather an intriguing
little problem

244
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,894
Well, I take it that

245
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:55,351
he was just an ordinary petty thief
and didn't know the value

246
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:58,016
That is a possible explanation
yet I venture to say

247
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,063
that the average petty thief
has a more extensive knowledge

248
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,338
of the value of <i>objet dar</i>
than the average collector

249
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,318
Well, anyway, that's gotten the odysary

250
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,785
They didn't get very excited about it

251
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,587
That's consistent, anyway

252
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:12,416
I wonder if I might see your collection
Mr. Emery

253
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,846
Oh, of course you could, yes

254
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,194
Nothing a collector likes more
than showing off his trophies

255
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,604
When would it suit you?

256
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,686
No time like the present

00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:21,035

that box in the robbery

I wouldn't blame them for that

especially as I told them
I was quite unable to describe the thief

321

except of course for the fact that

322
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,227
it was definitely a man

my man was trying to revive me

326
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:20,937
It might be wise for you
to put that box away somewhere

00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:22,698

rather than running into
any possible danger

00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:34,077

aren't you being a bit of an alarmist?

00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:36,862
I must agree with old Stinky

336
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:39,642
it seems to me you are making
rather a mountain out of a moleskin

Holmes, I can't understand
why you were so mysterious

342
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:54,780
Seems to me the petty thief explanation
was the only sensible one

343
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,749
Really?

344
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,556
I can't see how you could believe
it was anything else

345
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,459
I didn't say I believed it
to be anything else

346
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,488
The petty thief theory is the

347
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:01,994
obvious one, I grant you

348
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,432
However, it's often a mistake
to accept something as true

349
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:06,040
merely because it's obvious

350
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,214
The truth is only arrived at

351
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:12,402
by the painstaking process
of eliminating the untrue

352
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:15,294
We are not able to do that in this case

353
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:16,692
without further data

354
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,477

What a perfectly wonderful
collection of musical boxes!

You know, when you told me
you had a collection

I had no idea it was so attractive

394
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,461
They appeal to the ear

395
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,386
as well as to the eye

396
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:31,016
Oh, what a plain little one

397
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:34,477
Why it looks just like a country cousin
amid all this grandeur

No, no, no, no, you mustn't
underestimate the country cousin

Only last night a burglar broke in here

400
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:42,120
And with all these to choose from
went after the one very much like it

401
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,085
Really?

402
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:44,990
Yes, I don't mind
the loss of the box so much

403
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,030
but I do resent this crack on the skull

He was here this evening with a friend

A Mr. Holmes

412
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
He's interested in my collection too

413
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,484
Sherlock Holmes?

414
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:01,931
Yes, do you know him?

415
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:03,700
I've heard of him

416
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,653
He seems to think I'm in some sort of, uh

00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:07,955

00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,794
What a haunting tune!
It takes me right back to my childhood

419
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:11,919
Really?

420
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,765
See that's odd that you should be
interested in that particular musical box

421
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:15,821
Odd, why?

422
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,623
'Cause Mr. Holmes is also interested in it

423
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:21,437
He may have been more
interested in the tune than in the box

424
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:22,756
By Gilders, that's right

425
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,114
I remember now

426
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,651
He whistled it note for note
having only heard it once

427
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:27,996
Really?

428
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,367

00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:35,431
Course not

432
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:37,401
Who'd want a box like that?

433
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,334
I would

00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,767

I'm a collector, you know

438
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,697
and a collector buys but never sells

439
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:50,751
But, if the price were high enough

440
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,638
Price has nothing to do with it

Indeed?

476
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,658
You didn't mention that
when I telephoned you, Mr Holmes

Well, it's no time to start
talking about that now, Dr.

00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,245
Apparently it's gone

486
00:22:06,245 --> 00:22:10,398
That's the second attempt on the musical
box that Emery bought at the auction sale

487
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:11,883
and this time it was succesful

488
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:14,155
But that box was only worth £2

489
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:15,761
It was worth a man's life, Watson

00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,133
I think we better pay a visit
to Gaylord's auction room

491

and that fellow Crabtree

492
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:22,911
Inspector, may I suggest that you make
a complete search of this flat

493
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:26,295
for a small plain musical box
about that size

494

Thank you, come on, Watson

the third to the unidentified young lady

who presumably has a shop
and lives near Gilder's Green

499
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:41,902
That's right Mr. Holmes

500
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,961
Isn't it rather strange Mr. Crabtree

501
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:47,379
that you used to have three identical
musical boxes all playing the same tune

502
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,260
Where did they come from?

503
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,215
Dartmoor Prison

504
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,018
Dartmoor?

505
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:52,145
We get a regular shipment
from there every month

506
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,721
The inmates manufacture them

507
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,187
Well, they make all kinds
of things, you know

508
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:57,479
pipe racks, waste paper baskets
musical boxes-

509
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,562
Did you happen to notice

510
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:01,051
if anyone showed any particular interest

511
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:02,079
during the auction

512
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,581
and the purchases of these three boxes?

513
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,077
Oh, come now, Mr. Crabtree

514
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:10,245
this is very literally
a matter of life and death

515
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,163
Well, since you put it that way
Mr. Holmes

516
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,226
There was a gentleman came in here
about an hour after closing time

517
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,183
and he was in an awful state, he was

518
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:21,327
He gave me £5 to tell him
where the boxes had gone to

519
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,971
He said they had
a sentimental value for him, sir

520
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,657
Hmm, explains his sentiment

521
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:26,288
Can you describe him?

522
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:28,354
He was tall, distinguished looking
and he had

523
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:30,847
grey hair and a mustache
He was quite a gentleman, sir

524
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,384
And what was his reaction

525
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:34,050
when you were unable to supply him

526
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,133
with the address of the young lady
who owned the shop?

527
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,907
I told him the young lady
usually come back on Thursday

528
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:41,357
He said he'd come back on Thursday
and that's tomorrow

529
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:43,603
Thank you Mr. Crabtree
you've been very helpful

530
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:44,565
Thank you!

531
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:45,548
Come along, Watson

532
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:46,877
Where are we going now, home?

533
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:49,864
Well, I'm going to Mr. Kilgour
the man who bought the third box

534

535
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:57,303
But hang it all, Holmes

536
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,270
How do you know those other two
musical boxes are of any importance?

537
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,735
I don't, but I certainly have no intention

538
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:03,849
of waiting till the owners
are murdered to find out

(buzz)

540
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:07,907
No one at home

541
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:09,647
I hope that's the explanation

542
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,165
Well, have a look through this window

543
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,130
Doesn't seem to be anyone there

544
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,920
The whole place seems deserted
as far as I can see

545
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:25,388
Yes

546
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,669
Mr. and Mrs. Kilgour at home?

547
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:27,434
No

548
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:28,549
When do you expect them?

549
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:29,991
Oh, in an hour or so

550
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,255
There's no use [inaudible]ing about

551
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:34,010
They don't buy nothing from peddlers

552
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,758
Peddlers! My good woman
this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes

553
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:39,189
Sherlock Holmes? Oh, go on

554
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:40,931
You mind if we come in and wait?

555
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:42,599
My business is rather urgent

556
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,756
Well, I got to go out and do me shopping

557
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:49,254
and I don't know if Mrs. Kilgour
would like any strangers nosing about

558
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,484
Quite all right, I assure you

559
00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:52,106
Well, I've got to be off

560
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:53,774
You two wait in the parlor

561
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:55,502
and no smoking either

562
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:58,527
Mrs. Kilgour says it smells up the 'ouse

563
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:02,210
Funny old girl, Holmes

564
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,250
Hmm

565
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:22,049
Park Place

566
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,063
Park Lane

567
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,086
and what would the likes of you
be doing in Park Lane?

568
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:27,115
Now don't worry about the theatre

569
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:29,529
if you know how to get to
Park Lane, off it

570
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:36,918
You know, Holmes, I've been thinking

571
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:40,312
There must have been something
hidden in that box of old Stinky's

572
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,960
stolen jewelry, possibly

573
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,865
What's up, Holmes?

574
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:46,604
Listen

575
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:49,474
[knocking]

576
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:51,429
That's just the steam in the water pipes

577
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:58,432
Watson!

578
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:02,379
Great Scott!

579
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:04,421
Come on, Holmes

580
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,310
get her on the chair here

581
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,829
It's all right, my dear

582
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:12,042
There, there, there

583
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:13,466
Now don't worry

584
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:15,618
It's all over

585
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:18,864
There you are, dear, don't cry any more

586
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:21,613
She tied me up and shut me in the cupboard

587
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,282
I know, I know

588
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,604
She won't come back

589
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:27,137
Did you show her your new musical box?

590
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:30,202
Yes, she said she wanted to hear it play

591
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,777
and as soon as I showed it to her
she grabbed on-

592
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:36,289
I know, I know, I know, now don't worry
We'll buy you a new musical box

593
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:37,986
Yes my dear, the best one in London

594
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:39,404
Watson

595
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,607
Oh, what a fool, what a fool I've been

596
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:43,477
What do you mean, Holmes?

597
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,328
She took the musical box out of this house
in that market basket

598
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:48,303
right under our very noses

599
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:51,651
Why, do you think the Kilgour char woman
would want to take the music box?

600
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,227
She isn't the Kilgour char woman

601
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:54,621
She's a considered actress

602
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:57,430
An extremely clever, unscrupulous woman
who will stop at nothing

603
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,256
Take care of the child, will you
till her parents get back

604
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:01,652
Explain everything to them

605
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:02,602
Of course I will

606
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,805
Holmes! Where are you going?

607
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:06,144
Somewhere, somehow

608
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:09,065
I must get to the young lady
who bought that third musical box

609
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:10,794
before our opponents find her

610
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:12,655
I only hope that I won't be too late

611
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:21,149
Oh no, no no no darling, you
you mustn't cry anymore

612
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:22,674
Now, cheer up

613
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:26,774
Would you like to hear old Uncle
make a noise like a duck?

614
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:36,768
[quacking]

615
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:38,004

A lady of the French court

a fine nineteenth century doll

00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:53,494
a costume and exact replica
of the holiday clothes

637
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:55,730
worn by the Hungarian peasant women

638
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,419
Now, ladies and gentlemen

639
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,991
an item like this could cost you
from £15-20 in a western shop

640
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,729
I'm not going to ask
for anything like that

641
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:04,510
Who'll give me £2 for it?

642
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,251

what this beautiful doll is worth

650
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,641
So it's going once

651

may I draw your attention to something
which may be a great surprise to you

656
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,513
worthy of any collection

657
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:39,676
The only other one like it
is in the British museum

658
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:43,023
It's a Ming vase of the seventh dynasty

659
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:46,097
This vase lay in a large collection

660
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:49,880
somewhere outside Rome for over
two centuries as I understand it

661
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,164
It was discovered there by the Notre Dandy
Crilliams and Andrew Carperson

662
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,560
Now some of you may remember
Sir Andrew Carperson

663
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,355
besides being a noted traveler and
antiquarian he's also a gentlemen writer

664
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,211
The girl with a parcel
in her hands, that's her

665
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:08,905
Are you sure that's the girl?

666
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:11,977
Well, she fits definitely
the auctioneer's description

667
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,575
Follow her, Hamid

668
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:52,349
It's lovely, dear

669
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:53,679
And only £1

670
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,038
We can get at least three for it

671
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:56,119
Easily

672
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,746
I'll go make some tea

673
00:30:57,746 --> 00:30:58,867
I could do with a cup

674
00:30:58,867 --> 00:30:59,890
Right

Good afternoon

678
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm looking for a birthday gift
for a seven year old girl

679
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,739
What would you suggest?

680
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:10,591
We have some lovely dolls

681
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:12,031
Now this Hungarian peasant-

682
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:14,097
I think she has enough dolls already

683
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:15,180
Books are always welcome

684
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,727
Well, I'm looking for something
a little different

685
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,126
Now, that's rather cute

686
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,035
What is it?

687
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,485
Oh, that's a musical box

688
00:31:21,485 --> 00:31:23,242
Children always love them

689
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:25,827
and this is an exceptionally nice one

690
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:28,297
It plays many tunes

691
00:31:28,297 --> 00:31:33,360

692
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,798

Yes

694
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:37,996
If you'll just step this way

695
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,696
I have only two left

696

697
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,664

Are you sure this is all you have?

699
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:53,565
I'm sorry

700
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:55,240
they're rather hard to find, you know

701
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,014
That's our entire allotment

702
00:31:57,014 --> 00:32:00,386
I did have one other
but I sold it earlier this afternoon

703
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,131
But it was only a plain wooden one

704
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:04,322
It wouldn't have been
a very nice gift for a child

705
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,282
Really?

706
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:08,573
Do you happen to know
who the purchaser was?

707
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:09,997
Why yes

708
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:14,135
He left his card
just in case anyone should inquire for him

709
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:22,778
How interesting

710
00:32:22,778 --> 00:32:27,943
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I'll have to look a bit further

711
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:30,419
Thank you anyway

712
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,266

00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:18,802
We thought we were the hunters

721
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:22,090
instead of which we are the hunted

722
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,307
We've been fooled
We played right into his hands

723
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:27,314
Of course

724
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:28,938
He's had us followed

725
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,780
Don't look

726
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,751
The man in front of the toy shop

727
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:36,436
Hamin

728
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:39,009
Turn sharp right at the next corner
and again at the next

729
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,562
No photograph of her, Comissioner

730
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:49,728
as I expected

731
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,890
She's not a known criminal

732
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,359
But how do you expect to know her
if you do find her?

733
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,113
After all she was disguised
as a char-woman

734
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:57,127
Don't worry, old fellow

735
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:59,964
If I ever see her again I'll recognize her

736
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:03,983
Well, it won't be long till we know
who they are and from where they operate

737
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:05,115
Who's covering them?

738
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:07,140
Sgt. Thompson's following them, sir

739
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,726
They won't get away from him
He's a good man

740
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:12,064
We could have arrested them
at Tibert's Toy shop if we had any proof

741
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:14,162
But we know that they killed Emery

742
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:15,607
Proof, my dear fellow

743
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,234
We must have proof

744
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:20,345
We have x-rayed it, sir

745
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:21,832
There's nothing whatever
concealed in the box

746
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,598
We'll have a look at the plates

747
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:29,279
Hmm

748
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,683
There must be some clue

749
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:34,077
It'll probably be so obvious
that we've all overlooked it

750
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:36,647
Seems to me
we're up against a bunch of lunatics

751
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,859
Not lunatic's, my dear fellow

752
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,120
Extremely astute cold-blooded murderers

753
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:47,302
What could these little musical boxes
have in them that's so important

754
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,394
Don't forget they were made
in Dartmoor Prison

755
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:52,091
You can smuggle stuff into prison
but not out

756
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,328
You want us to break the box apart, sir

757
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:56,235
to see if the there's anything
the x-ray hasn't caught?

758
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:57,458
No, not yet

759
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,546
Do you mind if I take it?

760
00:34:58,546 --> 00:34:59,148
Certainly

761
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:02,055
Thanks

762
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,944
The governor of Dartmoor Prison
informed us, sir

763
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,612
in answer to Mr. Holmes question

764
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,685
that all three musical boxes
were made by the same convict

765
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:18,910
John Davidson

766
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,454
Serving a seven year term, sir

767
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,316
Davidson? The Bank of England plate?

768
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,187
That will be all

769
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,055
Yes, sir

770
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:26,412
Now we're getting somewhere

771
00:35:26,412 --> 00:35:27,819
If– wait a minute

772
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:29,964
How did you know
about the plates, Mr. Holmes?

773
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:31,983
I'm a student of crime, Inspector

774
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:34,015
I make it my business
to know about such things

775
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:36,137
and when the name
of Davidson was mentioned–

776
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:38,158
Who was this fellow, Davidson?

777
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:40,754
As long as Mr. Holmes seems to know
all about it already

778
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:43,149
I suppose there's no harm in telling you

779
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:46,743
Uh, two years ago in London

780
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,821
there occurred a robbery
of such tremendous importance

781
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:53,314
although the stolen articles
have no intrinsic value whatsoever

782
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:56,846
but the home secretary was instrumental
in seeing that not a word of it appeared

783
00:35:56,846 --> 00:35:58,151
in any newspaper

784
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,307
But you never told me
anything about this, Holmes

785
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:02,545
You were away at the time

786
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:05,879
Articles of no intrinsic value
and yet of such importance?

787
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,698
Hmph, I don't understand

788
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,715
Davidson was aprehended

789
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,774
within fifteen minutes of committing the theft

790
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:12,912
but by that time

791
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:16,088
he had hidden the articles in question
and they've yet to be found

792
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,296
Before going further, Dr. Watson

793
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:21,879
I must inform you that this matter's not
to be mentioned outside of this room

794
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,843
Course not

795
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,263
Do I look like a man who gossips?

796
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:26,757
Let's not go into that now
old fellow, shall we?

797
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:28,897
Davidson had been employed

798
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,024
for years

799
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,593
in a position of extreme trust

800
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:34,022
by the engravings department
of the Bank of England

801
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:36,046
The articles he stole were nothing less

802
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:40,723
then a complete set of duplicate plates
for printing £5 notes

803
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:41,928
What?

804
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:43,455
The Bank of England's own plates?

805
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:44,685
Precisely

806
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:46,891
and with those plates a gang of crooks

807
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,847
could flood England with £5 notes

808
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:51,117
not forged in the usual sense of the word

809
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:54,153
but notes undetectable
from genuine Bank of England notes

810
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:55,290
in any way whatsoever

811
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,512
Good heavens

812
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:59,623
Any whisper at all
might have resulted in enormous damage

813
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:02,004
in shaking public confidence
in the treasury

814
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:04,042
We tried everything
after we had arrested Davidson

815
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:06,967
Offered him a shorter sentence
if he'd tell us where he'd hidden the plate

816
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,556
Why we even put in

817
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:10,856
Scotland Yard men with him as cell mates

818
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,570
but, no result

819
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,446
Obviously Davidson is a man
of strong character and infinite patience

820
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,934
Yet suddenly he feels impelled

821
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:21,940
to smuggle out the secret
of the hiding place of the plates

822
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,782
to his confederates

823
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,041
Why?

824
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't understand, Mr. Holmes

825
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,626
Well, for example

826
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,604
had the Bank of England made any plans

827
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:32,095
to radically change

828
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,505
the design of the £5 notes
so that in say, uh

829
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,418
seven years from now

830
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:38,429
notes made from the stolen plates
would be worthless?

831
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:40,452
Confidentially , Mr. Holmes

832
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:41,908
such a move was discussed

833
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:44,027
but replacing all the £5 notes
in circulation

834
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,341
would be such a Herculean task that

835
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,234
nothing's been done about it as yet

836
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:49,796
I see

837
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:52,044
Of course there is another
possible explanation

838
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:55,588
Davidson didn't have much time to find
a hiding place before he was captured

839
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:56,976
He may be afraid

840
00:37:56,976 --> 00:38:01,595
that the plates will be accidentally
discovered before he is released

841
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:03,264
hence his anxiety

842
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,340
to communicate their whereabouts
to his confederates as soon as possible

843
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,282
I believe you've hit it, Mr. Holmes

844
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:13,238
I'm sure that the message
is contained in this musical box

845
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:17,031
Or rather in all three musical boxes

846
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,173
since possession of all three
seems to be essential

847
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:23,110
Our opponents have 2/3 of the puzzle
and we have 1/3

848
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,500
Oh, what are you going to do, Holmes?

849
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,772
Try to deduce the methods
from the 1/3 that we have

00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:35,883

It's the same tune as the one
played by Emery's musical box

856
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:15,486
and yet it's different

857
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:17,870
Sounds the same to me

858
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,036
The tune

859
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:23,181
Somehow the tune

860
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:25,315
is the key to the mystery

861
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,700
It must be the tune

862
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,084
otherwise why use three musical boxes
to convey the message?

863
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:34,365
Why not collar boxes or shoe boxes?

one of the first principles

I'm done, I'll give it to you
old fellow, will you

1078
00:49:41,786 --> 00:49:45,746
The first altered note, write yes first

1079
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:49,083
Now the eighth, the key

1080
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:51,892
is H

1081
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:53,716
The fifth key, E

1082
00:49:53,716 --> 00:49:57,369
The twelfth key

1083
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,414
L

1084
00:49:58,414 --> 00:50:00,961
The sixth key, F

1085
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,369
S-H-E-L-F

1086
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:04,833
Shelf

1087
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:08,055
Your piano lessons
were not in vain, old fellow

1088
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:09,030
You've solved it

1089
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,315
Thank you

1090
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:13,755
Thanks, old man, ha!

1091
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:17,237
We now have two thirds of the message

1092
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:18,352
"Behind books"

1093
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:19,996
"Third shelf"

1094
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:21,165
"Secretary"

1095
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,018
"Doctor S"

1096
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,503
Presumably

1097
00:50:25,503 --> 00:50:28,484
these are the first and second
portions of the message

1098
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:32,003
And this gang has the first
and third parts of it

1099
00:50:32,003 --> 00:50:32,989
Precisely

1100
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:33,928
Then it's a stalemate

1101
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:36,040
Yes, Commissioner
but we can't leave it like that

1102
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,126
There's no doubt in my mind
that they'll try to secure

1103
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:40,524
our third of the message that's missing

1104
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:43,910
I assume you've taken every precaution
to guard the third music box

1105
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,085
Oh, yes, it's carefully hidden at Baker St

1106
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,389
with Dr. Watson on guard, however

1107
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:48,562
I'm reasonably certain that, uh

1108
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:50,117
difficult as it may be

1109
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,066
we can find the plates

1110
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:53,236
even without the missing part
of the message

1111
00:50:53,236 --> 00:50:59,286
"Behind books, third shelf
secretary, doctor S"

1112
00:50:59,286 --> 00:51:02,428
Outside of the fact that Davidson hid
the Bank of England plates

1113
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:04,123
somewhere in London, Mr. Holmes

1114
00:51:04,123 --> 00:51:05,116
I don't see that we could rest at all

1115
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:07,067
Allow me to point out to you, sir

1116
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,032
the key words

1117
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,904
"Doctor S"

1118
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,840
It looks as though the plates were hidden
in the house of a doctor

1119
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,821
Whether the "S" stands
for his first or last initial

1120
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:19,257
remains to be determined
by a process of elimination

1121
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:22,269
Frill, there must be ten thousand
doctors in London with

1122
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:24,506
"S" for a first or last initial

1123
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:25,741
Precisely

1124
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:28,348
and every one of them
will have to be questioned in person

1125
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:31,062
That's why I say
this is a task for Scotland Yard

1126
00:51:31,062 --> 00:51:32,283
It's a task all right

1127
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:36,165
but Scotland Yard has searched worse
haystacks and found a needle

1128
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:37,553
Well, for the time being

1129
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,345
I'll leave the matter
in your hands, gentlemen

1130
00:51:40,345 --> 00:51:43,453
We'll call you if and when
we get a lead on our

1131
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:45,009
mysterious "Doctor S"

1132
00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:50,288
In the meantime I intend to follow up
a little clue concerning a cigarette

1133
00:51:53,098 --> 00:51:56,774
Mmm

1134
00:51:56,774 --> 00:51:59,405
You are certain of the identification
of the tobacco?

1135
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:00,706
Absolutely

1136
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:04,057
I have made up this special blend
for only three customers

1137
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:06,843
It is almost pure Egyptian

1138
00:52:06,843 --> 00:52:07,497
Mmmhmm

1139
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:09,441
with a mixture of Laticia

1140
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:10,953
for added body

1141
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:13,086
and a pinch of Parich

1142
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:15,928
merely a whisper as one might say

1143
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:17,814
for elusive fragrance–

1144
00:52:17,814 --> 00:52:19,728
Yes yes, and the, um, the three customers?

1145
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:23,339
Major Wilson in Bombay, India

1146
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:23,962
Mmmhmm

1147
00:52:23,962 --> 00:52:26,722
Mrs. Catherine Leenington Smith

1148
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:27,252
Mmmhmm

1149
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:28,067
in Ireland

1150
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:28,961
Yes, and the third?

1151
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:31,029
Mrs. Hilga Courtney

1152
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:32,798
of Park Mansions

1153
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:33,923
Bryanston Square

1154
00:52:33,923 --> 00:52:34,641
Thank you

1155
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:36,273
Thank you very much
you've been most helpful

1156
00:52:36,273 --> 00:52:38,674
It's a pleasure to have
been of service, Mr. Holmes

1157
00:52:39,664 --> 00:52:41,691
(buzz)

1158
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:47,411
(buzz)

1159
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,502
Yes

1160
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:51,206
Mrs. Courtney

1161
00:52:51,206 --> 00:52:52,196
Yes

1162
00:52:52,196 --> 00:52:53,862
My name is Sherlock Holmes

1163
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:55,451
Oh, do come in

1164
00:52:55,451 --> 00:52:56,551
Thank you

1165
00:52:56,551 --> 00:52:58,654
I've heard of you, of course, Mr. Holmes

1166
00:52:58,654 --> 00:53:03,537
I believe we have a mutual friend
in Sir Edward Brookdale

1167
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,906
He's spoken to me of you quite often

1168
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:06,903
Indeed?

1169
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:12,572
And to what good fortune
am I indebted for this visit?

1170
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:14,625
I think you know, Mrs. Courtney

1171
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,753
Well, I did get a summons
for speeding last week

1172
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:22,355
but outside of that I don't think I'm
of any interest to the police

1173
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:24,059
Oh, come now, Mrs. Courtney

1174
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:26,051
you seem to forget
that you and I have met before

1175
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:27,381
I'm sorry

1176
00:53:27,381 --> 00:53:30,328
I'm sure I would have remembered
meeting the great Sherlock Holmes

1177
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:31,964
Please sit down

1178
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:32,788
Thank you

1179
00:53:32,788 --> 00:53:35,573
You say we met before

1180
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:36,402
Yes

1181
00:53:36,402 --> 00:53:41,502
At the home of Mr. and Mrs. Kilgour
143 B. Hampton Rd

1182
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:43,629
Kilgour

1183
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:46,301
I don't think I know anyone of that name

1184
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:48,675
Well, I didn't say you knew them

1185
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,708
As a matter of fact you called on them
when they were out

1186
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,742
I don't understand, Mr. Holmes

1187
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:57,009
Really?

1188
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:58,664
And you were dressed rather differently

1189
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:00,048
Indeed

1190
00:54:00,048 --> 00:54:03,515
Cigarette?

1191
00:54:03,515 --> 00:54:06,642
Thank you

1192
00:54:06,642 --> 00:54:18,807
Thank you

1193
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,234
You know, Mrs. Courtney

1194
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:24,775
people generally forget

1195
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:26,039
you're assuming a disguise

1196
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:30,211
but the shape of the ear
is an almost infallible means

1197
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,747
of recognition and identification
to the trained eye

1198
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:35,100
Evidently you've mistaken me
for someone else

1199
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,085
Oh, no, not at all
though naturally I expected your denial

1200
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:42,068
But when you payed your visit
to my rooms at Baker St

1201
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:43,799
You carelessly left behind

1202
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:46,825
another identification

1203
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:51,870
I don't eglartha

1204
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,495
Yes, I must admit they are

1205
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:55,304
You see Mr. Holmes

1206
00:54:55,304 --> 00:54:58,852
to catch one as clever as you
I had to use a very special lure

1207
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:01,862
I knew you'd be unable
to resist the bait of my cigarette

1208
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:04,204
Having read with great interest
your monograph

1209
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:07,921
<i>On the Ashes of 140
Different Varieties of Tobacco</i>

1210
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:11,680
I should advise you
not to move, Mr. Holmes

1211
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,830
I must congratulate you
on your ingenuity, Mrs. Courtney

1212
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,807
It was indeed a brilliantly designed trap

1213
00:55:18,807 --> 00:55:20,533
Thank you, Mr. Holmes

1214
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:23,302
Praise from a master is indeed gratifying

1215
00:55:23,302 --> 00:55:27,462
I shall always cherish the memory
of your flattering words

1216
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:29,708
Memory?

1217
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:32,053
Precisely

1218
00:55:32,053 --> 00:55:35,487
I'm afraid these gentlemen
have a most regrettable task to perform

1219
00:55:35,487 --> 00:55:36,709
Unless of course

1220
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,212
you care to turn over
the missing musical box

1221
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,880
with your pledge to take
no action against us in the future

1222
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,016
I'm afraid that will be impossible

1223
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:48,110
I thought that would be your answer
Hamid!

1224
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,665
Careful!

1225
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:52,223
Careful

1226
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,688
There's no need to be so unnecessarily
rough with our distinguished guest

1227
00:55:55,688 --> 00:56:00,591
You realize, Mr. Holmes, that your demise
will not take place here, the, uh

1228
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:03,205

Well, naturally

1230

Shall we go?

1231
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:10,912
So fearfully awkward
having a dead body lying about

1232
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:12,893
Don't you agree, Mr. Holmes?

1233
00:56:12,893 --> 00:56:13,862
Another dead body

1234
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:16,568
should not weigh too heavily
on your conscience, Mrs. Courtney

1235
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:28,661
You mind if I have a cigarette?

1236
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:31,051
Well, I don't see why not

Well, I-I really came to see Mr. Holmes

Thank you

You know

1285
01:00:34,073 --> 01:00:38,000
Sherlock Holmes and I have been engaged
on a great many cases

Oh, really?

we're involved in one of the most baffling–

1290
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:46,335
Well, oh, won't you tell me your trouble?

1291
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:47,851
I may be able to help you

1292
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,683
Very kind of you, Dr. Watson

1293
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:51,239

I live in Therough, Dr. Watson

1301
01:01:04,514 --> 01:01:06,687
and-and I've come up to London
in sheer desperation

1302
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,754
my only sister has disappeared

1303
01:01:08,754 --> 01:01:11,082
and the local police seem utterly
unable to find her

1304
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:13,397
Well, Holmes and I solved a case
exactly like that once

1305
01:01:13,397 --> 01:01:15,648
very interesting as far as I remember

1306
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:20,437
I call it <i>The Adventure of 
the Solitary Cyclist</i>

1307
01:01:20,437 --> 01:01:21,584
Oh, sorry

1308
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:23,975
Now come to think of it
it wasn't so very similar

1309
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:25,599
Entirely different

1310
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,367
Couldn't think what I was saying

1311
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:30,183
Where were we?

1312
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:32,559
She's only seventeen, Dr. Watson, and

1313
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,170
until she disappeared last Thursday she

1314
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:37,483
seemed to be in the best of spirits

1315
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:40,575

Oh, no, no, nothing of the sort

She left no note

1318
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:46,483
didn't even pack a bag, no explanation

1319
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:50,116
She just started to walk to the village
from our house in broad daylight and

1320

simply vanished from the face of the earth

you wrote about my little experiment

It was planted here

1395
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:16,856
You got any bandaging around this place?

1400
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:25,149

Cheer up, old fellow, cheer up

1408

As Dr. Samuel Johnson once said

"There's no problem
the mind of man can set

1410
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:44,875
that the mind of man cannot solve"

1411

01:06:46,529 --> 01:06:48,030
Oh, just quoting Dr. Samuel Johnson

1413
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:49,335

of passing through

1418
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:05,178
to have his meager meals
in the dining on opposite

1419

James Bosswald

1421
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:12,046
We will now pass up the stairway

1422
01:07:12,046 --> 01:07:14,632
which remains in its natural wood finish

1423
01:07:14,632 --> 01:07:17,664

when the good doctor was here

The framed etching on the wall

1425
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:22,585
Is believed to have been
presented to Dr. Johnson

1426
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:24,420
by the distinguished painter

1427
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,891
Sir Joshua Reynolds

1428
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:31,585
I've been told here that that picture
was given in by Mrs. Thrail

1429
01:07:31,585 --> 01:07:33,206
and it's definitely not a Reynolds

1430
01:07:33,206 --> 01:07:35,017
Is that important, my dear?

1431
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:37,062

01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:45,111
The secretary's not on this floor

1436
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:46,167
Patience, Hamid

1437
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,470
I have a feeling–

1438
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,365
My dear Col. with Sherlock Holmes
out of the way what could go wrong?

1439
01:08:00,115 --> 01:08:02,143
And here we have the gallant library

1440
01:08:02,607 --> 01:08:05,039
in which Dr. Johnson
wrote his famous dictionary

1441
01:08:05,712 --> 01:08:07,207
and in which you will see also

1442
01:08:07,873 --> 01:08:10,488
many of the great man's books
and other items of interest

1443
01:08:11,573 --> 01:08:13,580
Step forward, ladies and gentle–
please step forward

1444
01:08:14,542 --> 01:08:16,177
Standing in the corner is the secratary

1445
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,850
which contains many of the original works

1446
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,347
by the literary genius

1447
01:08:21,324 --> 01:08:23,949
On this table, Dr. Johnson's cat Hodge

1448
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,048
used to sleep while his master worked

1449
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,641
The strange thing about this cat
ladies and gentlemen

1450
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:30,228
was it's love of oysters

1451
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,449
They do say that the dear doctor
often went hungry

1452
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:35,775
To find the cat that delicacy

1453
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,280
What a pity, hmm

1454
01:08:39,151 --> 01:08:41,718
Now we will visit the Grey Room
which is immediately below us

1455
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,119
in which you will see the very bed

1456
01:08:44,923 --> 01:08:46,592
in which Dr. Johnson died

1457
01:08:46,849 --> 01:08:48,115
What did he die of?

1458
01:08:48,115 --> 01:08:50,736
Gout

1459
01:08:50,736 --> 01:08:52,095
Just gout

1460
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:55,145
This way, ladies and gentlemen
mind the steps, please

1461
01:09:08,695 --> 01:09:10,090
Your keys

1462
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:28,156
Third shelf up

1463
01:09:28,156 --> 01:09:34,558
♪ (dramatic music) ♪

1464
01:09:34,558 --> 01:09:36,082
The knife

1465
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:43,280
Gentlemen, the Bank of England plates

1466
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:47,285
Well, Mrs. Courtney

1467
01:09:47,285 --> 01:09:49,927
so we meet again

1468
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:52,070
No, I shouldn't do that
if I were you, Col. Cavanaugh

1469
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,997
I must congratulate you, Mr. Holmes

1470
01:09:54,997 --> 01:09:57,020
You're far more clever than I thought

1471
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,406
Thank you, Mrs. Courtney

1472
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:03,849
Praise from you is indeed gratifying

1473
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:05,765
I shall always cherish the memory

1474
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:08,304
of your flattering words

1475
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,472
Memory?

1476
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,705
Oh, thank you

1477
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:15,751
And now I have a most
regrettable task to perform

1478
01:10:15,751 --> 01:10:18,613
(gunshot)

1479
01:10:19,852 --> 01:10:22,916
Holmes!

1480
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,531
Coming, Holmes!

1481
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:28,041
Holmes

1482
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:29,172
You alright?

1483
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:30,282
perfectly, thank you, old fellow

1484
01:10:30,282 --> 01:10:32,491
but I think this gentleman on the floor
requires some medical attention

1485
01:10:32,491 --> 01:10:35,374
we will see that he looks his best
you know, when he's hanged

1486
01:10:35,674 --> 01:10:36,785
Take them in charge

1487
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:55,277
Hmm, a brilliant antagonist

1488
01:10:55,277 --> 01:10:59,065
It's a pity her talents
were so misdirected

1489
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:00,719
Will you see
that these plates are returned

1490
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,304
to the Bank of England, Inspector?

1491
01:11:02,304 --> 01:11:04,104
I still don't understand
how you solved it, Mr. Holmes–

1492
01:11:04,104 --> 01:11:05,912
It's entirely due to Dr. Watson

1493
01:11:05,912 --> 01:11:07,470
He gave me the clue when he mentioned

1494
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,204
Dr. Samuel Johnson

1495
01:11:09,204 --> 01:11:11,129
Well, congratulations, Doctor

1496
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:12,036
Oh, thank you, Inspector

1497
01:11:12,036 --> 01:11:13,360
I don't think I could have
done it entirely

1498
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,176
without Mr. Holmes's help, you know

1499
01:11:15,176 --> 01:11:18,491
(laughter)
